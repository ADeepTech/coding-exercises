# Refactoring Exercise

The goal of this repository is to hold a set of exercises for those who want to improve their coding practice. Each exercise will be fully self contained and contain a set of instructions to guide the reader through the proper set of steps required to perform the exercise properly.

## Tooling

Tooling is very important for us to achieve the second goal. Below is the set of necessary tools we need to understand and be able to use

1. Version Control
2. Programming Language/Platform
3. Linter
4. Test Runner
5. Code Coverage Tool
6. Type System

### Version Control

### Programming Language/Platform

### Linter

### Test Runner

### Code Coverage Tool

### Type System

## Steps to Start

1. Clone this repository using `git clone`
2. In each exercise folder, there will be a document named `steps.md` which you can follow to perform the exercises

**Note** In general, exercises are designed to build on each other and skills gained in earlier exercises will be needed in later ones so it is recommended to proceed in order whenever possible.
