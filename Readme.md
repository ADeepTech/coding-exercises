# Coding Exercises

The goal of this repository is to hold a set of exercises for those who want to improve their coding practice. Each exercise will be fully self contained and contain a set of instructions to guide the reader through the proper set of steps required to perform the exercise properly.

## Steps to Start

1. Clone this repository using `git clone`
2. In each exercise folder, there will be a document named `Readme.md` which you can follow to perform the exercises
3. Follow along with the steps. You can check your answer against the published solutions. Solutions will always be in the `solutions` folder.

**Note** In general, exercises are designed to build on each other and skills gained in earlier exercises will be needed in later ones so it is recommended to proceed in order whenever possible.
