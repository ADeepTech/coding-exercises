# Test Harness

Adopting a test harness and understanding how to use it properly will be **absolutely critical** to your future success as an engineer. A solid testing harness and a robust test suite will allow you to move quickly and without fear when you make changes.

## Needed Tools

1. Version Control
2. Programming Language/Platform
3. Linter
4. Test Harness
5. Code Coverage Tool

## Setup

1. Ensure that `node >= 8.6` is installed
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm test`, you should expect to see all tests passing and some code coverage
4. Run `npm run report` to see the coverage reports

## Exercise
