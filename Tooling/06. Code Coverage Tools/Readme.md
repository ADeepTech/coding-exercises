# [WIP] Code Coverage Tools

Code coverage tools are a great complement to our testing harness that we set up previously. They are important to allow us to know the amount of code that is covered by tests and the different kinds of coverage that we have.

In this exercise, we will focus on understanding what coverage means, how to set it up, and how to increase it by changing our tests.

## Needed Tools

1. Version Control
2. Programming Language/Platform
3. Linter
4. Test Harness

## Setup

1. Ensure that `node >= 8.6` is installed
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm test`, you should expect to see all tests passing and some code coverage

## Goals

Our goals in the following exercises are:

1. Gain an understanding of what coverage is and what specific kinds of coverage there are and what they measure.
2. Learn how to set up code coverage tooling and reporting.
3. Learn how to improve code coverage by changing our tests.

## Steps

Our steps will be the following:
