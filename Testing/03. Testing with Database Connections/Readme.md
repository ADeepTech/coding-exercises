# Testing with Database Connections

Databases are very important tools for engineers to be familiar with and leverage correctly. Understanding how to properly test your code that works with databases will allow you to ensure that your application works correctly under all cases. Databases are especially tricky because they manage state that changes over time and the data lives outside of the application process memory so the logic we write must be very robust to be able to deal with any changes that may come.

In our exercises below, we will explore a few different databases and the options we have in testing them:

1. MongoDB
2. SQLite
3. [WIP] Postgres
